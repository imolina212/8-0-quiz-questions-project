**Q1:** What is the purpose of loops?

> Loops are among the most basic and powerful of programming concepts. A loop in a computer program is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed. The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required.

**Q3:** Can you use an infinite loop?
