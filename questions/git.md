**Q1:** What is git?

> Git is a distributed version control system. This means that a local clone of the project is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code.

**Q2:** Git vs Github?

> Since Git is the most popular version control system these days, many software developers use it in their work. Git itself is used on the local computer of a user to manage and keep track of changes in a project over time.

To collaborate and also to simply store their code on a server, software teams then need to pick a code hosting platform. GitHub is the most popular among many options like GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps, etc.

**Q3:** Why is git needed?

> Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers. Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.
